# leetcode
Java solutions to Leetcode problems with comments and basic test cases for each problem.. 



Todo:
 - Check test line coverage
 - Add checkstyle check.


## Techniques:

### Sorting
- The solution is a particular order of items, define the order relationship and sort
- Sort to establish an index which improves time complexity

### Binary Search

### Compression/Encoding
- Represent the data in a different way to improve performance.Either compress or decompression (establish indexing or convert to a structure where fast solution exists).

### DP
- Overlapping sub-problems: two sub-problems require the same computation
- Optimal sub-structure: easy to find a solution from solutions to sub-problems

### Relaxation/Generalize
- Map the problem to a more generic one where a solution to the generic one can be easily mapped back to the solution to the original problem
- Sometimes a looser definition of the problem is easier to solve because there will be less conceptual/physical conditions

### Recursion
- Enumerate all combination or permutation.


### Special
- Reverse sentence and then reverse each word
-
