 * https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
 * Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
 * The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.
 * Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
